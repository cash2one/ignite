                        <p><strong>IGNITE</strong>, not just a game, but a way of life. Our school, Wellington East Girls’ College, has the motto of “Taking the light and passing it on.” While there are many interpretations of the motto, many associate this
                            with knowledge. We, the creators, hope that this game will help people learn more about their house, house spirit and the technology used in the game. There are so many cool things about this world, may we all be able to
                            learn about them and pass that knowledge on. </p>

                        <p><strong>IGNITE</strong> the light, and pass it on!</p>
